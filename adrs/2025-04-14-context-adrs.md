# Using ADRs to document architecture decisions within the Security SIG

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As part of the [recommendation][rcmd] to ensure Renovate is enabled for
OpenTelemetry repositories, a [comment][cmt] was opened encouraging the
addition of simple documentation for future generations on why we've chosen
to use RenovateBot instead of Dependebot. This is a great example of what a
lightweight ADR process is intent on doing.

## Decision

This ADR serves as the grounds for future ADRs to be made.

## Consequences

We will have a better written record of the decisions made within the Security
SIG, which is inherently transparent to the rest of the OpenTelemetry project.
