# Vulnerability Management
OpenTelemetry is a large growing community of volunteers, users, and vendors. The OpenTelemetry community has adopted this vulnerability management policy to ensure we responsibly handle critical issues.

## Security Response Committee (SRC)

Security vulnerabilities should be handled quickly and sometimes privately. The primary goal of this process is to reduce the total time users are vulnerable to publicly known exploits.

The [Security Response Committee (SRC)](./src.md) is responsible for organizing the entire response including internal communication and external disclosure but will need help from relevant developers and release managers to successfully run this process.


## Disclosures

### Private Disclosure Processes

The OpenTelemetry Community asks that all suspected vulnerabilities be privately and responsibly disclosed via the Private Disclosure process available at [TBD].

### Public Disclosure Processes

If you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability please IMMEDIATELY email [TBD] to inform the Security Response Committee (SRC) about the vulnerability so they may start the patch, release, and communication process.

If possible the SRC will ask the person making the public report if the issue can be handled via a private disclosure process. If the reporter denies the request, the SRC will move swiftly with the fix and release process. In extreme cases you can ask GitHub to delete the issue but this generally isn't necessary and is unlikely to make a public disclosure less damaging.

## Patch, Release, and Public Communication

For each vulnerability a member of the SRC will volunteer to lead coordination with the Fix Team and Release Managers, and is responsible for sending disclosure emails to the rest of the community. This lead will be referred to as the Fix Lead.

The role of Fix Lead should rotate round-robin across the SRC.

All of the timelines below are suggestions and assume a Private Disclosure.
The Fix Lead drives the schedule using their best judgment based on severity, development time, and release manager feedback. If the Fix Lead is dealing with a Public Disclosure all timelines become ASAP. If the fix relies on another upstream project's disclosure timeline, that will adjust the process as well.  We will work with the upstream project to fit their timeline and best protect our users.

### Fix Team Organization

These steps should be completed within the first 24 hours of Disclosure.

- The Fix Lead will work quickly to identify relevant engineers and release managers from the affected projects and packages and CC those engineers into the disclosure thread. This selected developers are the Fix Team. A best guess is to invite all assignees in the OWNERS file from the affected packages.
- The Fix Lead may get the Fix Team access to [TBD] to develop the fix as required.
- The Fix Lead should start by sharing a quick overview of the entire security release process as outlined in the [Disclosures](#disclosures) section in this document.

### Fix Development Process

These steps should be completed within the 1-7 days of Disclosure.

- The Fix Lead and the Fix Team will create a [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) score using the [CVSS Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0). They will also use the [Severity Thresholds - How We Do Vulnerability Scoring](#severity-thresholds---how-we-do-vulnerability-scoring) to determine the effect and severity of the bug. The Fix Lead makes the final call on the calculated risk; it is better to move quickly than make the perfect assessment.
- The Fix Lead will assign a CVE ID to the vulnerability from the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA).
- The Fix Team will notify the Fix Lead that work on the fix branch is complete once there are LGTMs on all commits in the private repo from one or more relevant assignees in the relevant OWNERS file.

If the CVSS score is under ~4.0 ([a low severity score](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document#i5)) or the assessed risk is low the Fix Team can decide to slow the release process down in the face of holidays, developer bandwidth, etc. These decisions must be discussed on the [TBD] mailing list.

If the CVSS score is under ~7.0 (a medium severity score), the Fix Lead may
choose to carry out the fix semi-publicly. This means that PRs are made directly in the public OpenTelemetry repo, while restricting discussion of the security aspects to private channels. The fix lead will make the determination whether there would be user harm in handling the fix publicly that outweighs the benefits of open engagement with the community.

Critical and High severity vulnerability fixes will typically receive an out-of-band release. Medium and Low severity vulnerability fixes will be released as part of the next OpenTelemetry patch release.

Note: CVSS is convenient but imperfect. Ultimately, the Fix Lead has discretion on classifying the severity of a vulnerability.

No matter the CVSS score, if the vulnerability requires
[User Interaction](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide#5-4-User-Interaction),
especially in client components, or otherwise has a
straightforward, non-disruptive mitigation, the Fix Lead may choose to disclose the vulnerability before a fix is developed if they determine that users would be better off being warned against a specific interaction.

### Fix Disclosure Process

With the Fix Development underway the Fix Lead needs to come up with an overall communication plan for the wider community. This Disclosure process should begin after the Fix Team has developed a Fix or mitigation so that a realistic timeline can be communicated to users. Emergency releases for critical and high severity issues or fixes for issues already made public may affect the below timelines for how quickly or far in advance notifications will occur.

**Advance Vulnerability Disclosure to Private Distributors List** (Completed within 1-4 weeks prior to public disclosure):

- The [Private Distributors List](#private-distributors-list) will be given advance notification of any vulnerability that is assigned a CVE, at least 7 days before the planned public disclosure date. The notification will include all information that can be reasonably provided at the time of the notification. This may include patches or links to PRs, proofs of concept or instructions to reproduce the vulnerability, known mitigations, and timelines for public disclosure. When applicable, patches for all supported versions should be included. Distributors should read about the [Private Distributors List](#private-distributors-list) to find out the requirements for being added to this list.
- **What if a vendor breaks embargo?** The SRC will assess the damage. The Fix Lead will make the call to release earlier or continue with the plan. When in doubt push forward and go public ASAP.

**Fix Release Day**

Release process:
- The Fix Lead will cherry-pick the patches onto the master branch and all relevant release branches. The Fix Team will `/lgtm` and `/approve`.
- The Release Managers will merge these PRs as quickly as possible. Changes shouldn't be made to the commits at this point, to prevent potential conflicts with the patches sent to distributors, and conflicts as the fix is cherry-picked around branches.
- The Release Managers will ensure all the binaries are built, publicly available, and functional.
- The Fix Lead will remove the Fix Team from the private security repo once it is no longer needed.

Communications process:
- The [Private Distributors List](#private-distributors-list) will be notified at least 24 hours in advance of a pending release containing security vulnerability fixes with the public messaging, date, and time of the announcement.
- The Fix Lead will announce the new releases, the CVE number, severity, and impact, and the location of the binaries to get wide distribution and user action. As much as possible this announcement should be actionable, and include any mitigating steps users can take prior to upgrading to a fixed version. The recommended target time is 4pm UTC on a non-Friday weekday. This means the announcement will be seen morning Pacific, early evening Europe, and late evening Asia.
  The announcement will be sent via the following channels:
  - General announcement email to OpenTelemetry lists [TBD]
  - OSS-Security announcement email
    ([template](comms-templates/vulnerability-announcement-email.md)) to
    `oss-security@lists.openwall.com`
  - `#announcements` slack channel ([template](comms-templates/vulnerability-announcement-slack.md))
  - Tracking issue opened in [TBD] and prefixed with the 
    associated CVE ID (if applicable).
      - Once all communications are sent, fixes are released, and the CVE data has been populated, close out the public tracking issue.
  - Medium and Low severity vulnerability fixes that will be released as part of the next OpenTelemetry patch release will have the fix details included in the patch release notes. Any public announcement sent for
    these fixes will link to the release notes.
  - After public disclosure, populate the CVE details as soon as possible
  - TBD for more...

## Private Distributors List

This list is used to provide actionable information to multiple distribution vendors at once.

See the [private distributor list doc](private-distributors-list.md) for more information.

## Retrospective

These steps should be completed 1-3 days after the Release Date. The retrospective process [should be blameless](https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/postmortem-culture.html).

- The Fix Lead will send a retrospective of the process to [TBD]] including details on everyone involved, the timeline of the process, links to relevant PRs that introduced the issue, if relevant, and any critiques of the response and release process.
- The Release Managers and Fix Team are also encouraged to send their own feedback on the process to [TBD]. Honest critique is the only way we are going to get good at this as a community.

## Severity

The Security Response Committee evaluates vulnerability severity on a case-by-case basis, guided by [CVSS 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document). If you have questions about why a vulnerability is rated the way it is, please feel free to comment on the associated GitHub tracking issue.
