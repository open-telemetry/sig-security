# Security Response Committee Oncall

Security Response Committee (SRC) Oncall is a business-hours only oncall. That means you are not expected to
respond to issues outside of your normal daily working hours or on weekends or
holidays. If you are taking vacation or will be unable to perform your oncall
duties, please swap oncalls or find coverage for that week. See [managing oncall
rotation](#appendix-managing-oncall-rotation).

## Handoff

When your shift ends, you may be the incident commander on one or more ongoing
incidents. If you are already invested in the incident and have the bandwidth
for it, you can continue managing the incident (thanks!), but _you are not
obligated to continue managing the incident!_

If you would like to handoff incident command:

1.  Start by **ensuring the tracking issue is up to date** - review the
    information in the issue description, and fill in or correct any missing
    details.
2.  **Leave a comment** to dump any additional context and state you have on the
    issue. Make sure to list any open questions or decisions and any pending
    action items.
3.  Reassign the issue to the next oncall.

Finally, reach out to the next oncall (email, slack, VC, your choice) to make
sure they're aware of the handoff and to answer any questions. _Until they've
explicitly acknowledged the handoff you are still the incident commander!_
