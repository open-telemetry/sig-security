# Security Response Committee (SRC)

The SRC is responsible for organizing the entire response including internal communication and external disclosure but will need help from relevant developers and release managers to successfully run this process.

### Security Response Committee Membership

New SRC members are nominated by current SRC members, and selected by [TBD]

The SRC is capped at 10 members.

#### Nomination

New members are nominated to the SRC by current SRC members. If you are interested in joining the
SRC, the best way to secure a nomination is through sustained participation and contributions in the
OpenTelemetry community.

To encourage diversity members will also abide by a 1/2 maximal representation from any one company at any time. If representation changes due to job shifts or mergers, then members are encouraged to grow the team or replace themselves through mentoring new members. Being overlimit should not continue for longer than 12 months to give time to identify and mentor new members.

A nomination should include:
1. Relevant credentials, including OpenTelemetry and security experience.
2. Statement of support from the nominating SRC member(s): ~1-3 sentences of why this person is a good candidate.
3. Statement of intent from the nominee: ~1-3 sentences of why they want to join the committee and are a good fit.

In the event that an SRC member has concerns with a nomination, they should privately reach out to
[TBD].

Nominations will be collected into a private Google doc shared between the SRC and Steering.

Nominations may be reused for new openings, but in that case both the SRC member and nominee should
reconfirm (or update) their statements.

#### Member selection

After the nomination deadline is passed, nominations will be shared with the Steering Committee.
Steering is encouraged to discuss the nominations in the next private monthly meeting, and reach out
to the SRC with any questions.

The final selection is made by discussion & lazy consensus, with a fallback to a vote.

In the event that an individual is on both the SRC and Steering Committee, they will be expected to
excuse themselves from the steering discussion & selection process (but may submit SRC nominations).

#### Stepping Down

Members may step down at anytime, and may nominate a replacement when they do.

#### Responsibilities

- Members should remain active and responsive, and participate in the [oncall rotation](./src-oncall.md).
- Members going on extended leave for up to 3 months (1-2 rotations) may pause their oncall duties, but should coordinate with other members to ensure the role is adequately staffed during the leave.
- Longer leaves of absense should be discussed on a case-by-case basis.
- Members of a role should remove any other members that have not communicated a leave of absence and either cannot be reached for more than 2 months or are not fulfilling their documented responsibilities for more than 2 months. This may be done through a super-majority vote of members.

New members are *not* expected to join the oncall rotation immediately, but are expected to start
learning the processes and ramping up. During that time, they are expected to complete a shadow and
reverse shadow rotation. The ramp-up time does not need to be formalized, but 2-3 months should be a
reasonable expectation.

##### Incident Commander

One of the primary responsibilities of the SRC is to coordinate incident response when a vulnerability is discovered. The incident commander is responsible for coordinating all the different parts of the security release process (but not handling all those responsibilities themselves), and seeing the incident through to the end (or handing off).

The incident commander defaults to the current oncall, but may be handed off to other SRC or OpenTelemetry maintainers.

##### Triage

The current oncall is responsible for triaging incoming vulnerability reports (both through the bug
bounty and email). For more details on the triage process, see [oncall
workflow](./src-oncall.md).
