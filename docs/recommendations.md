# Recommendations

This document lists recommendations from the Security SIG for
the consideration of OpenTelemetry SIGs.

## CodeQL Scanning

The organization uses [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) for semantic analysis
of the code in various repositories. The recommendation is to run CodeQL on every
pull request and on every commit to the main branch.

Issue: ([#15](https://github.com/open-telemetry/sig-security/issues/15))

### Conducting a self-audit for a project within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) like OpenTelemetry (OTel) can help ensure that the project aligns with CNCF's best practices and guidelines.

# steps to perform a self-audit for OpenTelemetry:

### Review CNCF Graduation Criteria:
Familiarize yourself with CNCF's graduation criteria, which are outlined in the CNCF Graduation Criteria document. This document provides guidelines on what is expected from projects at different stages (e.g., Sandbox, Incubating, Graduated).

### Documentation Review:
Review the project's documentation, including READMEs, governance documents, and contribution guidelines. Ensure that they are up to date and follow CNCF's best practices for documentation.

### Licensing and Intellectual Property:
Verify that all project code is properly licensed under an approved open-source license. Check for any third-party dependencies and ensure they comply with CNCF's licensing requirements. 4. Community Health:

### Evaluate the health of the OpenTelemetry community:
Check the mailing lists, forums, and chat channels for active discussions and engagement. Assess the diversity of contributors and maintainers.

### Project Governance:
Examine the project's governance model. Ensure that there is an open and transparent decision-making process. Verify that the project follows CNCF's guidelines for governance.

### Code Review and Contribution Process:
Review the project's code review and contribution process. Ensure that contributions are welcome and that there is a clear process for submitting and reviewing changes. 
### Release Process:
Verify that the project has a well-defined release process. Check for regular releases and adherence to semantic versioning. Ensure that release notes are clear and comprehensive.

### Testing and CI/CD:
Check the project's testing practices and CI/CD pipeline. Ensure that tests are automated and that the project maintains a high level of test coverage.

### Security Practices:
Evaluate the project's security practices. Ensure that vulnerabilities are addressed promptly and that there is a process for reporting security issues.

### Ecosystem and Adoption:
Assess the project's ecosystem and adoption. Check if other projects are integrating with OpenTelemetry, and if there is active usage and interest within the CNCF community.

### Compliance with CNCF Policies:
Ensure that the project adheres to CNCF policies, such as the CNCF Code of Conduct and CNCF IP Policy.

### CNCF Incubation or Graduation Proposal:
If the project is in the CNCF Sandbox or Incubating stages, consider preparing a proposal for advancement to the next stage. Follow CNCF's guidelines for such proposals.

### Seek Feedback:
Consider seeking feedback from CNCF maintainers and the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) regarding the project's compliance with CNCF best practices and its readiness for advancement.

### Document the Self-Audit:
Document the results of your self-audit, including any areas that need improvement or further attention.

### Continuous Improvement:
Commit to continuous improvement based on the results of the self-audit. Address any identified issues and work towards aligning with CNCF's best practices.
