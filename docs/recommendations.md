# Recommendations

This document lists recommendations from the Security SIG for
the consideration of OpenTelemetry SIGs.

## CodeQL Scanning

The organization uses [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) for semantic analysis
of the code in various repositories. The recommendation is to run CodeQL on every
pull request and on every commit to the main branch.

### Code signing is a security practice used in the software industry to verify the authenticity and integrity of software applications and code. It involves digitally signing software or code with a cryptographic signature, which can be used to confirm that the code has not been tampered with and was indeed created by the purported author or organization.

## Here's an investigation into code signing:

### Purpose of Code Signing:

Code signing primarily serves the following purposes: Authentication: It ensures that the software or code is from a trusted source. Integrity: It guarantees that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it was signed. Non-repudiation: It prevents the author from denying their responsibility for the code. Malware Prevention: It helps in preventing the execution of unsigned or tampered code.

### How Code Signing Works:

Code signing involves using a digital certificate and a private key. The process typically includes the following steps: The developer generates a cryptographic hash (checksum) of the code. The developer signs the hash with their private key to create a digital signature. The digital signature is attached to the code or software. Users or systems can verify the signature using the developer's public key to ensure it matches the code's hash.

### Types of Code Signing Certificates:

There are two main types of code signing certificates: Self-signed certificates: Typically used for testing purposes but not suitable for production environments. Certificate Authority (CA)-issued certificates: Provided by trusted third-party CAs. These are used for production code and are recognized by major operating systems and platforms.

### Platforms and Environments:

Code signing is used across various platforms and environments, including: Windows: Authenticode is used for signing Windows executables and scripts. macOS: Code signing with Apple Developer IDs is essential for distributing macOS applications. Linux: GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) signatures are common for package repositories and open-source projects. Mobile Platforms: Both Android and iOS require code signing for app distribution.

### Code Signing Challenges:

Code signing can present challenges, including: Managing and securing private keys. Expired certificates can break functionality. Revocation of certificates due to security breaches. Balancing security with user experience, as code signing may generate security prompts.

### Code Signing Best Practices:

To ensure the effectiveness of code signing, developers and organizations should follow best practices, including: Regularly update certificates and keys. Use hardware security modules (HSMs) to secure private keys. Implement a process for revoking compromised certificates. Securely store code signing artifacts.

### Open Source and Code Signing:

Some open-source projects also use code signing to enhance trust in their codebase. However, this practice may vary among open-source communities.

### Regulatory Compliance:

Code signing may be required or recommended for compliance with industry regulations and standards, such as PCI DSS and HIPAA.

### Code Signing and Malware:

While code signing helps prevent the execution of unsigned or tampered code, it's not a guarantee against malware. Attackers may obtain compromised certificates or exploit vulnerabilities.

### Code Signing in DevOps:

Code signing can be integrated into DevOps pipelines to automate the signing process and ensure signed code is deployed.
